# lp

Just tinkering, wanted to play with Qt but not C++. PyQT seems to be the best option then.

You chose a file, it plays it using libvlc. 

To come: 
- [ ] album player

Not to come:
- [ ] Video
- [ ] Playlists

To be removed:
- [ ] single file/song chooser

### Just play the damn record. Use those hands for something else.
